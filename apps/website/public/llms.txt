# BikiniBottom (OpenSpawn)

> BikiniBottom is an open-source multi-agent coordination platform — the control plane for AI agent organizations. Define your org in a single markdown file (ORG.md), coordinate agents via A2A and MCP protocols, and watch them work in a real-time dashboard. Built on OpenClaw. MIT licensed.

BikiniBottom is infrastructure, not a framework. It doesn't replace your agent stack — it coordinates it. Works with CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, or any A2A-compatible agent.

The core concept is **ORG.md** — a markdown file that defines an entire agent organization: hierarchy, roles, domains, reporting chains, culture, policies, and playbooks. Agents read their roles from this file the same way OpenClaw agents read SOUL.md.

The project is at demo stage (February 2026). The live demo at bikinibottom.ai shows 22 SpongeBob-themed AI agents across 5 departments coordinating to deliver 10,000 Krabby Patties.

## Architecture

The sandbox server is the brain. It parses ORG.md into an agent hierarchy, runs a tick-based simulation engine, and exposes REST + SSE + A2A + MCP endpoints. The dashboard connects via SSE for real-time updates. The website serves docs and marketing at root, dashboard at /app/.

Key components:
- **Org Parser** (`org-parser.ts`): Parses ORG.md markdown into typed agent hierarchy using unified/remark
- **Simulation Engine** (`simulation.ts`, `deterministic.ts`): Tick-based coordination with ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)
- **Replay Engine** (`replay-engine.ts`): Plays back recorded LLM simulation scenarios for zero-cost demos
- **LLM Provider** (`llm-provider.ts`): Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter with markdown-based decision prompts

## Optional

- [Live Demo](https://bikinibottom.ai/app/live): 75-second choreographed replay of 22 agents coordinating
- [Design Strategy Docs](https://github.com/openspawn/openspawn/tree/main/docs/strategy): Agent Communication Protocol, event-driven architecture, scenario engine, competitive analysis
