# OpenSpawn

> OpenSpawn is an open-source multi-agent coordination platform. Define AI agent organizations in markdown (ORG.md), coordinate via A2A and MCP protocols, and observe in a real-time dashboard. The tagline: "One agent needs a prompt. A team needs structure."

OpenSpawn provides the control plane for AI agent teams. It is infrastructure, not a framework — it coordinates agent stacks like CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, and OpenClaw rather than replacing them.

The core innovation is **ORG.md**: a markdown file that defines an entire agent organization — hierarchy, roles, domains, culture, policies, and playbooks. This is analogous to how OpenClaw uses SOUL.md for individual agent identity, but scaled to organizations.

- **Repo:** github.com/openspawn/openspawn (MIT licensed, Nx monorepo, TypeScript)
- **Live demo:** bikinibottom.ai (22 SpongeBob-themed agents coordinate in real-time)
- **Framework site:** openspawn.ai
- **Protocols:** A2A v0.3, MCP (Streamable HTTP), Model Router
- **CLI:** `npx bikinibottom init my-reef`
- **Created by:** Adam Dennis (@adamwdennis)
- **Status:** Demo stage (February 2026), open source, actively developed

## Key Concepts

- **ORG.md**: A markdown file that IS the org chart. Agents read their roles, reporting chains, and policies from it. Sections: Identity (mission/vision/values), Culture (presets like startup/enterprise), Structure (agent hierarchy with levels, domains, avatars), Policies (budgets, caps, permissions), Playbooks (escalation protocols, handoff procedures).
- **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)**: Internal message protocol — ACK, Progress, Escalation, Completion. Push for urgent (escalations), pull for optional (progress).
- **Agent Levels**: L1 (intern) through L10 (CEO). Higher levels get event-driven triggers, lower levels poll. L7+ can spawn sub-agents.
- **Simulation Modes**: Deterministic (rule-based, zero LLM), Hybrid (L7+ use LLM), Record (capture decisions), Replay (playback for demos).
