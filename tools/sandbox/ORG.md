## Policies

### Budget
- **Per-agent limit:** 1000 credits/period
- **Alert threshold:** 80%
- **Overage behavior:** pause and escalate

### Department Caps
- The Kitchen (Engineering): max 10 agents
- The Register (Operations): max 14 agents
- The Vault (Finance): max 4 agents

### Permissions
- L7+ can create tasks and spawn agents
- L6+ can review and approve work
- All agents can escalate — nobody should be silently stuck

## Playbooks

### New Task Arrives
1. CEO receives task from Human Principal
2. CEO categorizes by domain and priority
3. CEO delegates to appropriate VP (SpongeBob for build, Squidward for deliver/customer, Squilliam for finance)
4. VP acks and breaks into subtasks if needed
5. VP assigns to leads, leads assign to workers by trust score
6. Workers ack and begin work — progress logged to task activity

### Escalation: BLOCKED
1. Agent creates escalation with blocker details
2. Escalation goes to direct manager (never skip levels)
3. Manager has 2 cycles to respond: provide context, reassign, or escalate further
4. If unresolved after 2 levels, alert CEO → Human Principal

### Escalation: OVERWHELMED
1. Agent flags capacity exceeded — task queue too deep
2. Manager evaluates: reassign tasks, or escalate for more resources
3. VP can request temporary workers from CEO (costs credits)
4. CEO approves or reallocates from another division

### Escalation: OUT_OF_DOMAIN
1. Agent flags task as wrong domain
2. Manager re-delegates to correct VP/lead
3. Original agent is freed — no trust penalty

### Cross-Division Handoff
1. Kitchen completes a batch → handed to Register for delivery
2. Squidward (or delegate) picks up from the window
3. Delivery confirmed → task marked complete
4. If delivery queue backs up → Squidward escalates for help

### New Agent Onboarding
1. New agent spawned by a VP or lead
2. First 3 tasks are LOW priority (warm-up period)
3. Trust score starts at 30 (PROBATION)
4. Mentor assigned: closest senior in same domain
5. After 5 successful tasks, promoted to TRUSTED
