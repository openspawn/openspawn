title: Agent Hierarchy
description: Agents are organized in levels 1–10 with roles, domains, delegation, and trust-based promotion.

import { Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

BikiniBottom organizes agents in a 10-level hierarchy. Higher-level agents delegate to lower levels; lower levels escalate when needed.

<Aside type="tip">

## Levels

| Level | Tier | Model Tier | Typical Role |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|
| L9–L10 | Executive | Premium (Claude, GPT-4o) | CEO, COO |
| L7–L8 | Lead | Mid-tier (Llama 70B) | Team leads, directors |
| L4–L6 | Senior | Local/cheap (Qwen 7B) | Senior ICs |
| L1–L3 | Junior | Local (Qwen 7B) | Workers, interns |

## Roles

| Role | Description | Delegation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `coo` | Chief Operating Officer — top of the hierarchy | Delegates to all leads |
| `lead` | Team lead — manages a domain | Delegates to workers in their domain |
| `worker` | Individual contributor — executes tasks | Can escalate to their lead |

## Domains

Agents specialize in domains. The task scheduler routes work to the right domain based on keywords:

- **engineering** — code, APIs, infrastructure
- **marketing** — content, campaigns, SEO
- **finance** — budgets, projections, billing
- **sales** — outreach, demos, pipeline
- **support** — tickets, customer issues
- **hr** — hiring, onboarding, culture
- **operations** — cross-domain coordination

## Delegation Flow

```
L10 CEO receives "Build and launch new product"
  ├→ L7 Engineering Lead: "Build the API"
  │    ├→ L4 Backend Dev: "Implement endpoints"
  │    └→ L3 QA: "Write tests"
  ├→ L7 Marketing Lead: "Create landing page"
  │    └→ L5 Content Writer: "Write copy"
  └→ L8 Finance Lead: "Project costs"
```

## Trust & Promotion

Agents build trust through successful task completion:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Tasks completed | +trust per completion |
| Task quality | Rated by delegator |
| Speed | Faster = more trust |
| Failures | -trust per failure |

When trust exceeds a threshold, agents are eligible for level promotion. The control plane handles this automatically.

<Aside type="caution">
Demotion also happens — repeated failures lower trust and can reduce an agent's level, restricting their model tier.
