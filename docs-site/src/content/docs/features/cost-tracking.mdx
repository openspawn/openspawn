BikiniBottom tracks every token spent across all providers, attributing costs to individual agents.

## How It Works

Every LLM request passes through the model router, which logs:
- **Which agent** made the request
- **Which provider** handled it
- **Token count** (input + output)
- **Estimated cost** based on provider pricing

## Credit System

Agents operate on a credit budget. Credits map to estimated token costs:

| Tier | Default Budget | Replenishment |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Executive (L9–L10) | Unlimited | — |
| Lead (L7–L8) | 1000 credits/day | Daily reset |
| Worker (L1–L6) | 100 credits/day | Daily reset |

<Aside type="caution">
When an agent exhausts credits, their requests are queued until replenishment. Executives can override.

## Cost Attribution

```bash
curl https://bikinibottom.ai/api/router/metrics
```

```json
{
  "totalCost": 12.15,
  "costByProvider": {
    "ollama": 0,
    "groq": 4.23,
    "openrouter": 7.92
  },
  "localRoutedCount": 748,
  "cloudOnlyCostEstimate": 47.82
}
```

The `cloudOnlyCostEstimate` shows what you'd pay without local routing — typically 3–5x more.

## Budget Limits

Set per-agent budgets in your configuration to prevent runaway costs:

```json
{
  "router": {
    "preferLocal": true,
    "providers": ["ollama", "groq"]
  }
}
```

Using `preferLocal: true` ensures L1–L6 agents use Ollama (free) whenever available.

## Savings Calculator

The dashboard shows a real-time savings calculator comparing actual spend vs cloud-only:

```
Cloud-only estimate: $47.82
Actual cost:         $12.15
Saved:               $35.67 (74%)
```
