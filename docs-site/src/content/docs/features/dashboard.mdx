import { Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

BikiniBottom includes a full real-time dashboard built with React and TanStack Query, accessible at the server root.

<Aside type="tip">
See it live at [bikinibottom.ai](https://bikinibottom.ai) — 32 agents running now.
</Aside>

## Overview

The dashboard starts automatically when you run `npx bikinibottom start`. It provides:

- **Agent network graph** — Visualize the org hierarchy and active connections
- **Task timeline** — Real-time feed of task creation, delegation, and completion
- **Cost charts** — Per-provider spending, savings calculator
- **Agent status** — Idle, busy, offline for every agent
- **Router metrics** — Provider health, latency, fallback frequency

## Pages

### Home
The main view shows the agent network graph with live task flows. Agents light up when working, and connections animate when delegating.

### Tasks
Lists all tasks with filtering by state (submitted, working, completed, failed). Click any task to see its full delegation chain and artifacts.

### Agents
Grid view of all agents showing level, domain, status, and current task. Sortable by any column.

### Router
Provider status dashboard: which providers are online, rate limit usage, cost breakdown, and latency distribution.

## Accessing the Dashboard

```bash
# Local
npx bikinibottom start
# Open http://localhost:3333

# Live demo
