title: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)
description: BikiniBottom's internal messaging system for agent-to-agent delegation, status updates, and coordination.

ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) is BikiniBottom's internal messaging layer. While A2A handles external communication, ACP handles how agents talk to each other inside the org.

<Aside type="tip">
Send an ACP message via MCP: `curl -X POST https://bikinibottom.ai/mcp -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"send_message","arguments":{"agentId":"tech-lead","message":"Status update please"}}}'`
</Aside>

## Overview

ACP messages are the "bubbles" 🫧 that flow between agents. They carry:

- **Task delegations** — "Here's a subtask for you"
- **Status updates** — "I'm 50% done"
- **Escalations** — "I need help from a higher level"
- **Results** — "Task complete, here's the output"

## Message Flow

```
CEO (L10) sends delegation → ACP → Engineering Lead (L7)
Engineering Lead delegates → ACP → Backend Dev (L4)
Backend Dev completes → ACP → Engineering Lead (result)
Engineering Lead reports → ACP → CEO (aggregated result)
```

## Message Types

| Type | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `delegation` | Down (higher → lower) | Assign a subtask |
| `status` | Up (lower → higher) | Report progress |
| `escalation` | Up (lower → higher) | Request help or approval |
| `result` | Up (lower → higher) | Return completed work |
| `broadcast` | Lateral | Org-wide announcements |

## Observing ACP Messages

ACP messages are visible in:
- The **dashboard** task detail view
- The **SSE stream** when streaming a task
- The MCP `send_message` tool for direct messaging

```bash
# Send a direct ACP message to an agent
curl -X POST https://bikinibottom.ai/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "send_message",
      "arguments": {
        "agentId": "tech-lead",
        "message": "What is your current task status?"
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Message delivered to Tech Lead" }],
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

## ACP vs A2A

| | ACP (Internal) | A2A (External) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Within the org | Between orgs/clients |
| Transport | In-memory event bus | HTTP REST + SSE |
| Discovery | Automatic (org hierarchy) | `/.well-known/agent.json` |
| Use case | Delegation chains | Cross-system integration |
