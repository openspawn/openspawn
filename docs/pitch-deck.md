## Slide 2: The Problem

### Managing AI Agents is a Nightmare

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 💸 **Mystery bills** — "Why did my API costs 10x?" | See exactly which agent, which task, how much |
| 🤷 **Zero visibility** — "What are my agents doing?" | Real-time dashboard, event feed, status |
| 🔥 **Runaway loops** — $500 burned in an hour | Budget limits, alerts, automatic stops |
| 🎭 **No accountability** — "Who approved that?" | Full audit trail, approval workflows |
| 🏚️ **Flat structure** — Chaos at scale | 10-level hierarchy, clear chains |

**Every company running AI agents at scale hits these problems.**

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

### The AI Agent Market is Exploding

- **2024**: Early adopters running 3-5 agents
- **2025**: Teams running 10-50 agents  
- **2026+**: Enterprises with 100+ agent workforces

**The infrastructure doesn't exist.**

Companies are:
- Building custom solutions (expensive, time-consuming)
- Flying blind (risky, unscalable)
- Limiting agent usage (leaving value on the table)

**OpenSpawn is the missing layer.**
