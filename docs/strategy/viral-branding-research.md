## The "Underwater" Brand Identity Deep Dive

### Mascot/Character Options

**Option 1: Agent Jellyfish**
- Jellyfish = distributed, networked (tentacles)
- Glowing, bioluminescent (tech vibes)
- Multiple jellyfish = multi-agent swarms
- Cute, non-threatening

**Option 2: Coral Agent**
- Coral = ecosystem, interconnected
- Colorful, vibrant
- Growth metaphor (scaling agents)
- Less character, more abstract

**Option 3: Octopus Orchestrator**
- Octopus = intelligent, multi-armed (multi-tasking)
- Each arm = different agent
- Problem: might be complex to illustrate

**Recommendation: Agent Jellyfish**
- Most visual potential
- Swarm behavior fits multi-agent metaphor
- Cute, approachable, memorable
- Can animate (floating, glowing)

### Visual Metaphors

**Agent Spawning = Jellyfish emerging from depths**
**Agent Communication = Bioluminescent signals**
**Agent Swarms = Jellyfish blooms**
**Scaling = Ocean depth (surface to abyss)**
**Performance = Current speed**
**Memory = Ocean capacity (infinite)**

### Naming Conventions (Inside BikiniBottom)

**API/Functions:**
- `spawn()` ← launch agent
- `swarm()` ← multi-agent group
- `current()` ← message stream
- `depth()` ← agent hierarchy level
- `bubble()` ← isolated environment
- `tide()` ← scheduled tasks
- `reef()` ← agent cluster

**Agent Types:**
- Jellyfish (standard agent)
- Eel (fast, specialized)
- Crab (stateful agent)
- Dolphin (communicative agent)
- Whale (large model agent)

**Ocean Puns (Use sparingly):**
- "No pressure" (ocean depth pun)
- "Making waves in agent orchestration"
- "Dive deep into multi-agent systems"
- "Surface-level simplicity, ocean-depth power"
- "Keep your agents afloat"

### Illustration Style Guide

**Style:**
- Flat, modern (not realistic)
- 2-3 color palette per illustration
- Consistent line weight
- Geometric shapes with organic curves
- Underwater gradients (light to dark)

**Elements:**
- Jellyfish agents (primary)
- Bubbles (communication, events)
- Waves (data streams)
- Coral (infrastructure)
- Sand (foundation)
- Light rays (performance)

**Tools:**
- Figma for design
- Illustrations by designer or:
  - Undraw.co (customize colors)
  - Humaaans (customize characters)
  - Custom commission (Dribbble, Fiverr)

### Website Design Direction

**Homepage Hero:**
- Animated ocean scene (CSS/SVG)
- Jellyfish floating across screen
- Bubbles rising
- Code terminal overlay (showing agent spawn)
- CTA: "Dive In" (ocean pun)

**Color Gradients:**
- Header: Deep blue → lighter blue (top to bottom)
- Sections: Alternating ocean shades
- Buttons: Coral orange (high contrast)
- Code blocks: Dark mode (deep sea theme)

**Typography:**
- Headers: Bold, modern (Inter, Outfit)
- Code: Monospace with ligatures (JetBrains Mono)
- Body: Readable sans-serif (system fonts)

**Animations:**
- Parallax scrolling (ocean depth)
- Floating elements (jellyfish, bubbles)
- Hover effects (glow, ripple)
- Smooth transitions (wave-like)
- Performance-conscious (no jank)
